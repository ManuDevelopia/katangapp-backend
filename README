# Contributing
In order to contribute to the project, please fork the repository, add the
functionality you want, or fix any bug you like, and send a pull request to the
main repository, which is hosted here:[https://bitbucket.org/craftsmanshiptoledo/katangapp-backend](https://bitbucket.org/craftsmanshiptoledo/katangapp-backend).

Our team will work on its review and try to merge it into the `dev` branch. For
that reason, **always send the pull requests to the dev branch**, which is the
development branch for this purpose.

The `master` branch is a frozen branch, only updated with releases of the
project.
